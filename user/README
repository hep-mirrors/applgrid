Examples
--------

Some example code. Prerequisites are the root is installed, as is 
the applgrid coe. 

The hoppet library should be installed if arbitrary renormalisation 
and factorisation scale variation is required.

To build the executables simply type

  make

The example executables are  

i)   stand.cxx (builds executable stand)

   is an example of how you might read in some grids and perform 
   the convolution using lhapdf

ii)  fnmain.cxx (builds executable fnlo)

   is an example of how you might read in a fastnlo grid using the 
   fastnlo interface

iii) fmain.cxx fstand.f (builds executable fstand)

   is an example of how you might use the fortran interface to read
   in native applgrid grids and also fastnlo grids using fortran.

Since the applgrid code is written in c++, in order to mix fortran 
and c++ and not be restricted to only the io of one of the 
languages, it is necessary to link with both the c++ and fotran
run time libraries.

It is chosen to do that by linking as a c++ program and linking 
against the fortran rtl by hand, hence the implementation of 
main() in fmain.cxx

Execution
---------

In order to run, there needs to be some data to run on, the makefile
includes some targets to fetch some fastnlo data and the data for 
the atlas inclusive jet cross section using 

make getdata

following this you can run the example executables.
